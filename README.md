## Posible tool improvements
Shoptet Bender is an open-source project, so your PRs are very welcomed. There are some suggestions for possible features, as Shoptet don't have the resources to develop this tool actively. So it is left as is for your active development. Some minor feature updates are possible.
What could be done:
- [ ] tools integration (Gulp, Grunt)
- [ ] files concatenation
- [ ] HEAD and BODY scripts location - this could better emulate admin fields
